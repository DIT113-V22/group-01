## Introduction

<a name="what"></a>
### What we are going to make

Crushers is dedicated to prepare you to **crush the test**, the theoretical drivers license test that is. We are going to do so by providing an app which quizes you on the traffic laws, signs, and scenarios. Our app will provide you with explanations, visual illustrations, and a hands on manual driving mode to give you the full experience and prepare you like you have never before been prepared for a test.

<a name="why"></a>
### Why we will make it

The simple reason why we assigned ourselves with this mission is the fail rate for the drivers license exam, theory and driving. Keeping calm and focused in a busy and noisy environment as the road, especially within cities, can be difficult and leads to accidents yearly. Some accidents, however, could be mitigated through better knowledge of driving theory. To date most apps focus on the theoretical exam, but our goal is to combine the theory with visual illustrations showing why a certain traffic law/sign is necessary and a manual driving mode in a virtual city to also train you for the driving test.

**What problem it solves**

Fail rate of drivers license exams in Sweden (2021)

![59% fail the theory test and 52% fail the driving test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52662014/160342758-7d2307f5-fed8-4d68-b21b-6e3106f1162e.png)

<a name="how"></a>
### How we are going to make it
To accomplish our goal, we will create a remotely accessible api for the car, provide our end users with an android app, and lastly create a city environment for the emulator for the manual driving and scenario demonstrations. The main focus for the project will lie on the app, and depending on the time available at the end we have some cool ideas for the emulators city environment.

**What kind of technology we are going to use**
| Component | Technologies |
| --------- | ------------ |
| Car controller | Arduino, C++, smartcar shield |
| Car - App communication | MQTT |
| App | Android, Java |
| City environment | SMCE, Blender, etc. |

<a name="installation"></a>
### Installation Procedure

1. We require an MQTT broker in order to be able to drive via app. There are a variety of MQTT brokers to choose from, however we choose Mosquitto for our needs.
    - **What exactly is an MQTT broker?**
    <br>It is a software running on a computer. it could be any computer, from raspberry pi to a pc to a server. Broker is available as either open-source
      or proprietary with extra features added on. 
      Broker acts like a post-office, where instead a device sending a message to or getting a message from another device directly. They send to
      post- office (broker) and then it is forwarded to everyone that needs that message.
      
    - **Why do we need a broker?**
    - We will need a broker to connect the app to the SMCE so we can practice driving.

    - **How may a Mosquitto broker be set up?**
    - Here's a clear explanation for how to download Mosquitto. Choose your operating system and follow the instructions:[Download Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/download/) 

2. We need to download SMCE (the car environment), which will allow you to practice and improve your skills.
    - **How are we going about doing it?**
    - Please see this page for instructions on how to install SMCE on [MacOs](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/wiki/MacOS-setup), [Windows](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/wiki/Windows-setup), or [Debian based Linux](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/wiki/Debian-based-Linux-setup)

3. Download **Crusher's crash course** from Google play
