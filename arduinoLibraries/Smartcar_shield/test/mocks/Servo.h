/**
 * Servo "mock" class. Ideally our ServoMotor class would be using composition
 * to become an (Arduino) Servo motor. However, we want to make usage easier and
 * transparent to the user, so we are extending the Arduino Servo class.
 * The inheritance instead of composition makes things a little bit trickier
 * to mock and that is why we need a stub implementation of `Servo` that can get
 * injected with the mock which in turn we can set our expectations upon.
