/**
   This sketch can be used to "calibrate" the motors that are connected to the motor shield.
   Particularly, the poles of the brushed DC motors should be connected on each terminal on the
   shield. However, that by itself does not guarantee that the motors will be spinning towards the
   intended directions.

   Upload the following code and open the serial monitor.
   Then the on-screen instructions, will guide you step by step, on how to connect the various poles
   in order to have all motors spinning towards the correct direction.
